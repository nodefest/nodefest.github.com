Now… what if I told you that you could hook up a LOT of buttons to your computer… and use it to do wild things with the web? I’m glad you’re listening! Let’s take a journey into the Web MIDI api where the possibilities of the web aren’t just at your keyboard fingertips anymore, they’re literally any MIDI compatible controller you have connected! Want to make glitchy audio responsive visuals with WebGL shaders? Rad, we can do that. Want to create custom beats and have those input as a drum machine? No problem when you throw a little Web Audio API in the mix. Let’s dive in and find out how!",,"Who loves pushing buttons? You? And you over there? And the person behind you?

#1 by sannekalkman - description,"In our daily development lives, most of us don’t have to worry about unused objects gathering cobwebs and filling up the memory. All we need to know is that our language has a garbage collector that just comes by and makes our trash disappear. Somehow it figures out what should stay and what can go, our program can keep going without running out of space, and we don’t have to do a thing.

It is not in fact magic that takes care of the garbage, and this talk will show you how it’s done. First, we’ll explore how two of the most common garbage collection algorithms, reference counting and tracing, figure out what is ready to be collected. Next, we’ll see how we could get the garbage truck out of the way faster by using a generational algorithm, and finally we’ll have a brief look at how Python’s garbage collection works.

This friendly introduction to taking out the trash gives an overview of important aspects of garbage collection algorithms. It is specifically meant to be accessible developers of all levels and you’ll walk away with an understanding of and appreciation for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes.",,"In our daily development lives, most of us don’t have to worry about unused objects gathering cobwebs and filling up the memory.

#1 by james_k_nelson - description,"Navi is a new kind of router: as your app's URL changes, it starts fetching the new URL's content, and then it *waits*. It then renders the page *once the content has loaded*.

Delayed rendering makes routing simpler. Instead of manually managing component state and loading spinners, you just assign URLs to content using `async`/`await` and `import()`. Navi does the rest -- it fetches your content, manages your page's `&lt;title&gt;` and scroll position, and even warns you about broken links!

In this talk, I'll introduce Navi, and use it to live code a static website with create-react-app.",,"Navi is a new kind of router: as your app's URL changes, it starts fetching the new URL's content, and then it *waits*. It then renders the page *once the content has loaded*.

#1 by kimamula - description,"今年の6月からNode.jsがサポートされたGoogle App Engine Standard Environmentで、Angularアプリケーションをserver-side rendering (SSR)した事例についてご紹介します。

Angular UniversalはAngularでSSRを可能にするためのプロジェクトであり、今回のアプリケーションはこのプロジェクトが提供するツールを利用しています。現時点で公式ドキュメントがあまり充実していないため、実際にアプリケーション開発を進める中で得られた知見を共有することで、その部分を補ればと思います。たとえば、開発中にローカルでファイルをwatchしながらSSRする方法や、サーバサイドで取得した状態をクライアントサイドに伝播する方法などが含まれます。

また、Angular Universalでは未提供の、必要なリソースをHTTP/2 Server Pushする機能を独自に実装し（ようとし）たお話もする予定です。","今年の6月からNode.jsがサポートされたGoogle App Engine Standard Environmentで、Angularアプリケーションをserver-side rendering (SSR)した事例についてご紹介します。
